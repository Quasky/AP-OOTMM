# OOTxMM
An Archipelago implementation of OOTxMM.

## Devolopment
Right now, the world is generated staticly, and does not automaticly import logic from OOTxMM into the AP world.  
Eventually, that'll be the ideal solution to move forward.  

Step 1 is just getting a viable product devoloped where the multiworld can generate and be playable as a v0.1.  
Then move to automaticly generate logic and rules based on the OOTxMM project.

The idea is to staticly map locations, items, regions, entrences, etc, to AP for the generator to break apart.
